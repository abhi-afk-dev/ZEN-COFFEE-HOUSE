# ☕ Zen Coffee House

A modern, minimal, aesthetic web application for a premium coffee brand. This project bridges the gap between design and code, featuring a custom UI/UX identity translated into a responsive React application.

> **✨ Design & Development:** This project was end-to-end executed by me — from the initial Figma wireframes and UI/UX design to the final React implementation.

## 🚀 Overview

Zen Coffee House is designed to evoke a sense of calm and premium quality. The goal was to create a digital storefront that matches the atmosphere of a physical high-end café. It showcases a menu, brand story, and a seamless user interface.
